# AuDHD: A Distinct Neurotype

## Important Note

AuDHD is considered a **separate and distinct neurotype** in this knowledge base, not merely an intersection or comorbidity of autism and ADHD.

## Rationale

While AuDHD shares features with both autism and ADHD, the lived experience and neurological profile of AuDHD individuals often represents a unique configuration that:

1. Creates emergent properties not present in either condition alone
2. Involves specific patterns of trait interaction and compensation
3. Results in distinct challenges and strengths
4. Requires tailored understanding and support approaches

## Key Distinctions

- **Internal Conflict**: Simultaneous need for routine (autism) and novelty (ADHD)
- **Masking Complexity**: Double masking of both autistic and ADHD traits
- **Executive Function**: Unique patterns where ADHD impulsivity may override autistic rigidity
- **Sensory Experience**: Combined hypersensitivity with sensation-seeking behaviors
- **Social Navigation**: ADHD social impulsivity conflicting with autistic social anxiety

## Documentation Approach

This directory contains information specific to the AuDHD neurotype as a unified experience, rather than attempting to separate "the autism parts" from "the ADHD parts."
